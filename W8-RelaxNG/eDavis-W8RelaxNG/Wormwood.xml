            <p>Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name role="Student">Irwin</name>, <name role="Student">Walter</name>, <name role="Student">Charlie</name>, <name role="Student">Roy</name> + <name role="Student">John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name role="Student">Roy</name> and <name role="Student">John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote>"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</quote> A I came across the <place>bridge</place> I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <name role="Student">Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up scripture

            argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us <quote>"backwoodsers."</quote> We went to bed early. <name role="Student">Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p>
            <date when="1896-02-01">February 1st. Saturday.</date>
            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to the <institution>Local Institute</institution>. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name role="Student">Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name role="Student">Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name role="Student">Roy</name> cut wood. <name role="Student">Mary</name> baked all morning.

He got letters from <name>Mamma</name>, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M.</name> got school journal and circular from supt. <name>McClure</name>.</p>

Argued about <quote>"Back woodsers"</quote> and <quote>"Mountain heathens"</quote>. They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to <place>town</place>. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to <institution type="religion">church</institution> with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the <place>fields</place>. <name role="Clergy">Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name role="Clergy">King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name role="Student">Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over

They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the

            lot. <name>Dolly</name> went to put Joe's hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name>Jess</name> says <name role="Only Good Looking Girl in Illinois">Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. <name role="Best Looking Man in Illinois">Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name>Jess</name> says <quote>"Dollie is - is - is, all right."</quote> <quote>"She's too smart to be called a backwoodser."</quote> <name>Roy</name>, <name>Nellie</name> and I are <quote>"Smart alecks."</quote> I went to bed at seven o clock.

            Had a very small <institution type="education">school</institution>, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. <quote>(If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.)</quote> I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
