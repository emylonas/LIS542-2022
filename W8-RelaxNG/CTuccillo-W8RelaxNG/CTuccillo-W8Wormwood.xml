At noon <name role="student">Irwin</name> and <name role="student">Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey."

Laughed at <name>Joe</name> and <name>Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name>Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young."

            <p>Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name role="student">Irwin</name>, <name role="student">Walter</name>, <name role="student">Charlie</name>, <name role="student">Roy</name> + <name role="student">John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name role="student">Roy</name> and <name role="student">John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <place>Modesto</place> paper. <name role="friend">Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture

            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise.

I fixed my tan skirt. <name role="student">Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name role="student">Roy</name> cut wood. <name role="friend">Irwin</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name role="friend">Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name role="friend">Ed</name> came in the evening.

Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jess</name>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name role="preacher">Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name role="preacher">King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name>Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over

            <p> Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name ><title type="general">Mr.</title> Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. Jess said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
