                <p>Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <name role="student">Irwin and Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <name role="acquaintance">Lou and Lillie</name> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <name role="acquaintance">Lillie</name>'s watch back with mine. – <name role="acquaintance">Jesse</name> laughs at me about being always hungry. <name role="acquaintance">Nellie and Mary</name> went to church. <name role="acquaintance">J</name> called us <quote>"Back woodsers"</quote> I replied, that <quote>I would rather be <pb n="p03"/> a "backwoodser" than a "heathen"</quote>. We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <name role="acquaintance">Mr. Strate</name>'s. Had music. Laughed at <name role="acquaintance">Joe and Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name role="acquaintance">Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <name role="acquaintance">John and Dollie</name> and I came across the pasture. (<name role="acquaintance">Dollie</name> thought we were going to <place>China</place>.) <name role="acquaintance">Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about <name role="residents">Kentuckians</name>. <name role="acquaintance">Peek's</name> brought <name role="acquaintance">Mary and Nellie</name> home. <name role="acquaintance">John Whitehouse</name> was converted. (<name role="acquaintance">John W.</name> came to school this evening for <name role="student">Lou and Lillie</name>. </p></entry>

                <p>Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name role="student">Irwin, Walter, Charlie, Roy + John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name role="student">Roy and John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote>"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</quote> A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <place>Modesto</place> paper. <name role="student">Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture <pb n="p05"/> argument; read two chapters from <name role="book">the Testament</name>, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us <quote>"backwoodsers."</quote> We went to bed early. <name role="student">Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p></entry>

            <p>February 1st. Saturday</p>
            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at Nilwood to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name role="acquaintance">Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name role="acquaintance">Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name role="acquaintance">Roy</name> cut wood. <name role="acquaintance">Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name role="acquaintance">Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name role="acquaintance">Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from <name role="acquaintance">Mamma, Ida and Katie M.</name> got school journal and circular from supt. <name role="acquaintance">McClure</name>. <pb n="p06"/> told about hauling one ([[note in parentheses above  -- Jermin?]]) of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name role="acquaintance">Joe</name> came home with <name role="acquaintance">Jess</name>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name role="acquaintance">Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name role="acquaintance">Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name role="acquaintance">Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name role="acquaintance">Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name role="acquaintance">Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name role="acquaintance">King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name role="acquaintance">Lillie</name>came to tell us about going over <pb n="p07"/>to <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name role="acquaintance">Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name role="acquaintance">Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two) </p></entry>

            <p>February 2nd. Sunday.</p>
            <p>Rainy and dark. <name role="acquaintance">Jess</name> went away. <name role="acquaintance">Charie Crawford</name> came. I read story of <name role="book">"Howard and his Teacher"</name>. Laughed about <name role="book">"Love in the Kitchen"</name>; also <name role="book">"Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".)</name> <name role="acquaintance">Roy</name> and I took down items; and <name role="acquaintance">Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <name role="acquaintance">Roy</name> but <name role="acquaintance">Charlie</name> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name role="acquaintance">Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the <pb n="p08"/><margin location="top"><name role="student">Irwin Baptist</name> is 16 years old today.</margin> lot. <name role="acquaintance">Dolly</name> went to put <name role="acquaintance">Joe</name>'s hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name role="acquaintance">Jess</name> says <name role="acquaintance">Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. <name role="acquaintance">Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name role="acquaintance">Jess</name> says <quote>"<name role="acquaintance">Dollie</name> is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser."</quote><name role="acquaintance">Roy, Nellie</name> and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet. </p></entry>

           <p>February 3rd.    Monday.</p>
           <p>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed <pb n="p09"/> Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name role="acquaintance">Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (<quote>If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.</quote>) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name role="acquaintance">Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p></entry>
