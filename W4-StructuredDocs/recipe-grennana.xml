        <title>Butter Beans, Paprika and Piquillo Peppers (1) </title>
        <summary>These beans are great in salads. Let the mix cool and then toss through a selection of salad leaves and herbs. Perk up the leaves with a little olive oil and vinegar and some crispy lavash on top. </summary>
   <ingredients> Ingredients 
    Serves 4 
    3 red onions, diced 
    125 ml (about 1 cup) extra-virgin olive oil, divided

    5 Tbsp. sherry vinegar 
    300g (10 42-oz.) jarred piquillo peppers, rinsed and sliced 
    Kosher salt  </ingredients>
    <instructions>Step 1 In a wide-based pan over a medium heat, caramelize the red onions in 5 Tbsp. of the olive oil for 15 minutes or until they turn golden and soft. Add a little fine salt, the garlic and spices and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the tomato purée and cook for another minute. 
    Step 2 
    Add the beans and sherry vinegar and reduce the liquid by half over a medium heat. Turn the heat off. Add the piquillo peppers and the remaining olive oil and season with salt to serve.

    <recipe> <title>Detroit-Style Pizza Dough  </title>
    <ingredients> <instructions>
    TOTALTIME 
    YIELD/SHAPE 
    Active 15-20 min/ 
    Inactive: 3% 
    two 35 cm by 25 cm/14 in by 10 in pizzas or three 25 cm by 20 cm/ 
    10 in by 8 in pizzas 
    MASTER RECIPE DETROIT-STYLE PIZZA DOUGH 
    3 h at 21°C/70°F, covered, or 2 h at 27°C/80°F and 65% RH; after the first hour, gently but assertively stretch the dough out again to fill the pan as evenly as possible 
    ASSEMBLE 
    distribute the cheese evenly over the preshaped dough, making sure that the cheese covers the dough all the way to the border and comes in contact with the pan 
    BENCH REST 
    15 min; cover well; perform a four-edge fold by pulling each edge of the rectangle of dough to the opposite edge; bench rest for 15 min; cover well; generously oil the Detroit pans 
    BAKE 
    bake according to the Detroit-Style Pizza Baking Times and Temperatures table (see below); warm the sauce to 70°C/160°F; once baked, remove the pizza from the pan and place on a serving tray; pipe or spoon dollops of sauce on the pizza; cut into 6 squares (2-by-3 grid) using a serrated knife 
    DIVIDE 
    35 cm by 25 cm/14 in by 10 in: 500 g 25 cm by 20 cm / 10 in by 8 in: 330 g 
    PRESHAPE 
    transfer dough to the prepared pans seam side down, trying to maintain the rectangular shape; coat the sur face of the dough lightly with oil and stretch the dough gently but assertively without damaging it to fill the pan evenly, making sure the corners are sharp 
    The 1 kg yield of the base recipe is not enough for the dough hook to catch all the ingredients and mix a uniform dough in an 8 qt bowl. 
    Forthe large pizzas, we use full-sized Detroit pans measuring 35 cm by 25 cm/ 14 in by 10 in. The small pizzas are made in half-sized Detroit pans measuring 25 cm by 20 cm /10 in by 8 in. We recommend that the pans be made from blue steel. 
    If the ingredient quantities aren't large enough forthe dough hook to mix them well in a stand mixeror commercial planetary mixer, use a paddle attachment initially to mix the ingredients uniformly. Once you have a homogeneous mass (the dough is sticky and wet, and there are no visible clumps or unincorporated water), switch to a hook attachment. 
    For a 35 cm by 25 cm/14 in by 10 in pizza, you will use 500 g dough, 150 g (s cup) sauce, 225 g (1%4 cups + 2 Tbsp) Wisconsin brick cheese, and 110 g (194 cups) pizza cheese. Fora 25 cm by 20 cm /10 in by 8 in pizza, you will use 330 g dough, 75g (a cup) sauce, 115 g (14 cup + 3 Tbsp) Wisconsin brick cheese, and 55 g (cup-2 Tbsp) pizza cheese. 
    The larger the yield, the longer the dough will take to mix. Final mix time at higher speeds may vary from machine to machine, Whatever the model and yield, the goal is to achieve a good mix and full gluten development 
    Some prefer to apply the sauce after cutting the pizza to prevent any sauce drag, We recommend this if you are piping the sauce on the slice rather than spooning it on. 
    To assess gluten development, perform the windowpane test. Take a portion of dough in your hands and stretch it: the more the dough can stretch without tear ing, the more the gluten has developed. The dough will hold the window for at least 8-10 seconds and it can be stretched to the point that it is nearly see-through when it has reached full gluten development 
    You might prefer to cut the pizza on a wooden cutting board and then slide it onto the serving tray so that you aren't using a metal knife on a metal surface. 
    If you are baking this in an oven other than an impinger oven, start checking the doneness of the pizza after 11-12 min. 
    When you divide the dough, try to keep the pieces as rectangular as possible.
