<salutation>Dear Cousins: </salutation>
<body>Pleasant having your 
company. Next time make 
it longer so that we 
can all get out and explore 
the peninsula together. 
Thanks for all the goodies! 
Am sure you managed 
to show yourself a good 
time in <location>Baltimore</location>. Cooled 
off a mite (degree or 2). </body>
<closing>Be well, and love,
