    <title>Sonnet 15: When I consider everything that grows</title>
    <author>BY: WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</author>
        <stanza><line>When I consider everything that grows</line>  
                <line>Holds in perfection but a little moment,</line>
                <line>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</line>
                <line>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;</line>
                <line>When I perceive that men as plants increase,</line>
                <line>Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,</line>
                <line>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</line>
                <line>And wear their brave state out of memory;</line>
                <line>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay</line>
                <line>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</line>
                <line>Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay</line>
                <line>To change your day of youth to sullied night;</line>
                <line>And all in war with Time for love of you,</line>
                <line>As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</line></stanza></poem>

        <heading>I</heading>
        <stanza><line>The winter evening settles down</line>
                <line>With smell of steaks in passageways.</line>
                <line>Six o’ clock.</line>
                <line>The burnt-out ends of smoky days.</line>
                <line>And now a gusty shower wraps</line>
                <line>The grimy scraps</line>
                <line>Of withered leaves about your feet</line>
                <line>And newspapers from vacant lots;</line>
                <line>The showers beat</line>
                <line>On broken blinds and chimney-pots,</line>
                <line>And at the corner of the street</line>
                <line>A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.</line></stanza>
        <stanza><line>And then the lighting of the lamps.</line></stanza></poem>

    <title>Recuerdo</title> <author>—Edna St. Vincent Millay</author>
            <line>We were very tired, we were very merry—</line>
            <line>We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.</line>
            <line>It was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable—</line>
            <line>But we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,</line>
            <line>We lay on a hill-top underneath the moon;</line>
            <line>And the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon.</line>
            <line>We were very tired, we were very merry—</line>
            <line>We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry;</line>
            <line>And you ate an apple, and I ate a pear,</line>
            <line>From a dozen of each we had bought somewhere;</line>
            <line>And the sky went wan, and the wind came cold,</line>
            <line>And the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold.</line>
            <line>We were very tired, we were very merry,</line>
            <line>We had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.</line>
            <line>We hailed, “Good morrow, mother!” to a shawl-covered head,</line>
            <line>And bought a morning paper, which neither of us read;</line>
            <line>And she wept, “God bless you!” for the apples and pears,</line>
            <line>And we gave her all our money but our subway fares.</line></poem>

    <title>Wild Mountain Thyme Lyrics</title>
    <stanza>Oh, the summertime is comin',
            And the trees are sweetly blooming,
            Here the wild mountain thyme
            Grows around the blooming heather</stanza>
    <stanza>Chorus
            Will ye go, lassie, will ye go?
            And we'll all go together to pick wild mountain thyme
            All around the blooming heather.
            Will ye go, lassie, will ye go?</stanza>
    <stanza>I will build my love a bower
            By yon pure crystal fountain
            And around it I will place
            All the flowers of the mountain.</stanza>
    <stanza>Chorus...
            If my true love e'er should leave me
            I would surely find another
            Where the wild mountain thyme
            Grows around the blooming heather.</stanza>
    <stanza>Chorus...
            Oh, the autumn-time is comin',
            And the leaves are gently falling,
            Where the wild mountain thyme
            Grows around the blooming heather
            Chorus...</stanza></poem>
